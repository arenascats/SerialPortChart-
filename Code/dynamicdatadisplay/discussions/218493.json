I was able to get the x &amp; y axis to reflect real data (rather than the data point number), as well as getting a few other things working with the help of Mikhail. However, now that he has left I have three open issues. Anyone with good knowledge of D3 should be able to help as the sample is fairly small and concise. I am having trouble binding to Viewport2D.ContentBounds, ViewportPanel.ViewportBounds, and cannot get the proper z value for my x,y position in a tooltip.</p>\r\n<p>Please have a look at the sample, my comments are in the areas that need work and are prefaced by &quot;QUESTION &gt;&gt;&quot;</p>\r\n<p>http://cid-be559ac3cb2dc573.office.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/Intensity%5E_Sample.rar</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks to anyone who can resolve this and thanks to Mikhail for all of his help thus far.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

I get an fps of ~ 1Hz.\r\nAs many others I would like to boost the fps by using DirectX. So I tried the latest Nightly and tried the D3-Line-in-3D Line3DSample, which looks very promising.\r\n\r\nHowever, upon startup it throws a FileNotFoundException in Plotter.cs:68\r\n  genericResources = (ResourceDictionary)Application.LoadComponent(new Uri(&quot;/DynamicDataDisplay;component/Themes/Generic.xaml&quot;, UriKind.Relative));\r\n\r\nAny solutions?\r\nAny forecast for when the DirectX support will be available in a stable release?\r\n\r\nBest Regards, \r\nelJorro\r\n",

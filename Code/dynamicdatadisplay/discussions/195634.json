I successfully accomplished this by mimicing the Simulation example which uses threading. Is there a simpler approach? In other words, if I have a DataSource in memory, instead of blasting everything at once using AddLineGraph(), can I somehow iterate through the DataSource and render just one line segment (betwen two ponts in the DataSource) at a time?</p>",

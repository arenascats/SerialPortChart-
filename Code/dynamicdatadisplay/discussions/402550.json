I found several examples online, using older versions of D3. When adding the sources of this version to my solution,\r\n I lost other functionality I was using - plotting a graph with logarithmic scales. Another version of D3 that was used in an example of a logarithmic scale did not have &quot;hide legend&quot; implemented yet. Apparently, the examples I've seen used different versions\r\n that are mutually exclusive. Moreover, I am not enough savvi with c# to take one version and convert it to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould you guys please please please help me and provide a solution that uses any (preferably latest) version of D3 for WPF that makes a ChartPlotter with logarithmic scale and is able to hide the legend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks</p>\r\n",

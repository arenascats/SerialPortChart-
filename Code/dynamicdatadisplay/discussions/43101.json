I would like to set my horizontal axis so that only whole numbers are used.  Fractional double values don't really make sense for the data I'm charting.  But I don't want to have to calculate the tick values manually.  I want the control to do it but also to use just whole numbers for the major ticks.  Can this be done?\r\n",

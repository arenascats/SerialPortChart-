This will disable mechanism of automatic charts' content bounds determining, and charts will arranged less times.</p>\r\n<p>2) Try to disable filtering - instead of using plotter.AddLineChart(dataSource) method, which internally creates an instance of LineGraph and adds to it some filters, create this chart manually, set a DataSource property and add to plotter.Children.</p>\r\n<p>3) Where is you data stored in? Maybe this also have some influence.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For now this is all what I can advise, maybe there are some extra information about this case you can share with me and which can help me to say more.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Best regards,</p>\r\n<p>Mikhail.</p>",

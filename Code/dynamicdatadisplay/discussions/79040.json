I noticed in an example that the CursorCoordinateGraph generates the mouse current position for the x and y. &nbsp;The X coordinate is exactly what I need, because it shows the mouse current position on the x axis, but the y is not- because I need to get the data's y position at a given x, not the y position of the mouse.</p>\r\n<p>How can I get the x and y data points representing my actual data at a given mouse x on mouse down or mouse over?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks and happy holidays!</p>",

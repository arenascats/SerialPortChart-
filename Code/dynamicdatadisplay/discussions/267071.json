Background: I have created a phasor class to show some rotating phasors and the according locusts in the ChartPlotter.</p>\r\n<p>Example: I have one phasor which is only changing its angle (rotating), so the according locust would be a circle. If another phasor would be longer on the x-axis, the locust would become elliptic.</p>\r\n<p>Second question:</p>\r\n<p>Is it possible to put the x- and y-axis in the middle of the plotter and not just on the sides?</p>\r\n<p>Sorry I searched a lot and could not find anything on these topics and i'm quite new to C# and WPF... :(</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance and greetings!</p>\r\n",

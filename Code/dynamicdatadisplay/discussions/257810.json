The problem is that for larger plots (e.g. 200 x 200 cells), the time taken to draw the plot\r\n is very high. The issue seems to be with Add() or AddMany() to the chart plotter's children - these methods take a long time to add so many rectangle highlights. Is there a way to speed this process up at all? Alternatively, is there a more efficient approach\r\n to setting up such a heat map (I'm sure there is - I'm still finding my way with D3...)?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance for any advice.</p>\r\n<p>Matt</p>\r\n",

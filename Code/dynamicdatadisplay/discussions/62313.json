Since I am new in WPF, I would like to ask you if we can use D3 to develop a intensity chart. In an intensity chart the value pair (X,Y) is represented as a pixel (or a small rectangle) with the value Y converted to a color at the position X.</p>\r\n<p>I have uploaded a pdf file illustrating the intensity chart at http://cid-7d30e9f415751779.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/DynamicDataDisplay/IntensityGraph.pdf</p>\r\n<p>Regards</p>\r\n<p>HDN</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\"><img alt=\"\"></p>",

Currently DynamicDataDisplay doesnot support three-dimensions graphics, and time when this support will come is indefinite.</p>\r\n<p>You can try to write your own control for displying such a surface on a WPF - there are rather many tutorials about how to do it.</p>\r\n<p>The left part, where (as I understood) section of 2d surface is drawn, is easier to do - you should only implement a logic which will build 1D data series by interpolating x and y values of surface.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I wish you luck in doing this, if you need some help on how to do it using D3 - you are welcome)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Best regards,</p>\r\n<p>Mikhail.</p>",

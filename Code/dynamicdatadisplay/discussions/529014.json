However when I add the code below my graph only shows the date 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM.<br />\n<pre><code>&lt;d3:ChartPlotter.FitToViewRestrictions&gt;\n      &lt;d3:FollowWidthRestriction Width=&quot;30&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/d3:ChartPlotter.FitToViewRestrictions&gt;</code></pre>\n\nI'm guessing the issue has to do with the width and setting that to match a Datetime instead of a double.\r<br />\n<br />\nWondering if anyone has any ideas for making this work or if it can be done at all?<br />\n",

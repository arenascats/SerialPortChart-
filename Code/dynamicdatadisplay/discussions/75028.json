    "Html": "<p>Good news! While I haven't dealt with the root cause of the issue, I did find a decent workaround that doesn't make me cringe too much.</p>\r\n<p>This stemmed from a discovery I made:<strong> If you move the chart - even slightly - you can add and remove data as much as you want and the chart will no longer have the graphical \"wobble\" along the x-axis anymore. </strong>I found that you can instead move the graph <em>programmatically</em> just a tiny amount, and the glitch will no longer be present.</p>\r\n<p>Here's how I solved the problem:</p>\r\n<p>After your chart has loaded, call the following FixChartGraphicalGlitch() method. This method moves the chart a <em>tiny</em>&nbsp;amount to the right - it isn't even visible - which fixes the glitch.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color: blue;\">private</span> <span style=\"color: blue;\">void</span> FixChartGraphicalGlitch()\r\n{\r\n    Rect visible = Chart_Helium.Viewport.Visible;\r\n    <span style=\"color: blue;\">double</span> width = visible.Width;\r\n    <span style=\"color: blue;\">double</span> height = visible.Height;\r\n\r\n    visible.Offset(-0.00001 * width, 0);\r\n\r\n    Chart_Helium.Viewport.Visible = visible;\r\n}\t\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\nAn important item to note is that, sometimes, if you interact with the chart too quickly after it has been filled with data, it can cause additional graphical problems. To deal with this, I simply use a System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherTimer with a 500 millisecond delay to fire the FixChartGraphicalGlitch() method after I've updated the chart.</p>",

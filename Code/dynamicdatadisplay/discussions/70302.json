I propose this solution:\r<br />\nI had the same problem, but i successed to find the solution:\r<br />\n<br />\nIn C# code, before to create the chart you write this:<br />\n<pre><code>       ChartPlotter m_Plotter = plotter    // creation of the chart, egal to the plotter which was create via xaml file\n\n   __ ____    m_Plotter.Legend.Visibility=System.Windows.Visibility.Collapsed;______ \n\n        m_Plotter.AddLineGraph(ds, new Pen(Brushes.Red, 1), null);\n</code></pre>\n\nAs you can notice, it is not &quot;Hidden&quot; but &quot;collapsed&quot;, that you must used.\r<br />\nlegend is not displayed.\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso THANKS A LOT Mikhail! for your excellent library!\r<br />\n<br />\nNicolas NGHIEM<br />\n",

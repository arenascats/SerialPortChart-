    "Html": "Hi\r<br />\n<br />\nDDD works very good for line graphs. Works very well(outperformed) than most of the paid controls.\r<br />\n<br />\nSince DDD is wpf char controls you can draw bubbles or markers very easily (you can very easily customize and can draw any shape)\r<br />\n<br />\nBut, If your requirement is more bubbles or custom markers (more than 5000) then you may get performance issues. Because here in DDD every control/ shape is children to parent control. (If you add 5000 children to parent panel/grid think what will happen).\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards\r<br />\nRavi.<br />\n",

    "Html": "<p>As mentioned in the previous answer about setting the origin you need to modify or remove the mouse and keyboard navigation objects. One way to do that is:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black;background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>plotter.Children.RemoveAll&lt;IPlotterElement&gt;(plotter.MouseNavigation.GetType()); </pre>\r\n<pre>plotter.Children.RemoveAll&lt;IPlotterElement&gt;(plotter.KeyboardNavigation.GetType()); </pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Note that while this prevents keyboard and mouse panning/zooming on the graph it still allows the panning/zooming on the horizontal and vertical&nbsp;axes. I'll leave it as an excersize for the reader to disable these</p>",

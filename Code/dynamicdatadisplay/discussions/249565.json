For example, At present my graph color is blue color and in my y axis , I am displaying some&nbsp; random double values(in between 250 and -250) and x axis shows time . So In my graph curve, the graph above a  certain limit (say 100) should be in red. Once the graph comes down below 100, then it should retain its old color( Blue). Is any feature exists in the D3 to support this?</p>",

I would like it to update less frequently so as to use less processor resources. I tried increasing the UpdateInterval in the PerfomanceDataSource. This does change how often data is requested from the performance counters, but the graph keeps speeding away at the same speed. How would I tell it to move slower (or faster for that matter)?</p>",

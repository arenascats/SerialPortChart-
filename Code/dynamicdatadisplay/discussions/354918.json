For the &quot;charting&quot; part of it, I've decided to use D3 (based on the great work of Felice Pollano and his blog\r\n -&gt; http://www.felicepollano.com/CategoryView.aspx?category=Charting).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It's working great but I have one small problem: Since stock markets are closed on weekends and holidays, those days are not in the data retrieved (witch is ok), but they are still displayed on the X-axis, which creates gaps in the chart.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Example: I have four dates in my data -&gt; may 3, may 4, may 7, may 8</p>\r\n<p>On the chart's x-axis you will have -&gt; may 3, may 4, may 5, may 6, may 7, may 8</p>\r\n<p>So since on may 5 and 6 I have no data, there's a blank diplayed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So the question: is there a way to display only dates on the X-Axis where I actually have data for? Or at least a hint of where I should check in the source code.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks, Guillaume.</p>\r\n",

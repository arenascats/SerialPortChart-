    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nHas anyone experienced a scenario where the x-axis of the chart gets messed up and the whole chart freezes? That is the x-axis keeps jumping with the spacing between the x-axis points continuously jumping back and forth and the chart becomes unusable? Usually happens when there are multiple linegraphs drawn at the same time, or when a additional linegraph is added which exceeds the current visible x-axis. Very hard to explain and reproduce though!\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks.\r<br />\nGanesh<br />\n",

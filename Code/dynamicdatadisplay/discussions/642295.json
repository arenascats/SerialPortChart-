Not sure how far this works, I didn't try this.\r<br />\nActually zooms you can Mange with plotter.Viewport.Visible. This works perfectly. Zoom states, previous zoom data/state and current zoom data/state you have to manage in your code.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards\r<br />\nRavi.<br />\n",

Would be great if you could provide a code snippet to handle that.\r<br />\n<br />\nCheers,\r<br />\nGanesh<br />\n",

I guess you know what should Y axis min value and max value, say these are yMin and yMax.\r<br />\nYou have X axis, You will be knowing xMin and xMax. If your X axis is date time axis, then you have to convert date times to xMin and xMax. \r<br />\nThe conversion is also very simple.\r<br />\nIf your  x axis name is timeAxis !<br />\n<pre><code>xMin = timeAxis.ConvertToDouble(StartTime);\nxMax = timeAxis.ComverToDouble(endTime);\nyMin = 0; // your y axis minimum value\nyMax = 100; // your y axis maxmimum value\nplotter.ViewPort.Visible = new Rect(xMin, yMin, xMax-xMin, yMax-yMin); // you will get your desired zoom in chart.</code></pre>\n\nHope this will full fill your requirement. \r<br />\nCheck old desiscussions also, you will get more ideas. zooming also discussed earlier in the discussions.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards\r<br />\nRavi<br />\n",

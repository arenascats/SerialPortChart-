Add multiple datasources. &nbsp;I need to draw the spectra, say in black, and then draw curves over some of the peaks in different colors to highlight them.</p>\r\n<p>3. Switch data sources. &nbsp;Since the data can be smoothed (for example), a user can click a checkbox that would switch the view between raw and smoothed data.</p>\r\n<p>4. Remove the grid background</p>\r\n<p>5. Enable/disable the crosshairs</p>\r\n<p>6. Autoscale on the Y axis</p>\r\n<p>Can D3 do all of these things? &nbsp;If so, awesome! &nbsp;Are there examples for any of these? &nbsp;(Im sure there are, but there are so many samples! &nbsp;Hard to tell where to find stuff)</p>\r\n<p>I am doing all of this with MVVM as well, so as part of exploring I have been trying to figure out how to add multiple data sources to a simple ChartPlotter via a binding in xaml but as yet I havent found it. &nbsp;Also, since I cannot draw 75,000 data points, I would definately need to filter the data- it seems there is some nice filtering stuff here, but Im not sure how to use it yet.</p>\r\n<p>I would most appreciate any help or suggestions!</p>",

    "Html": "\r\n<p>Hi everyone,</p>\r\n<p>I had a need to improve the performance of the LineGraph in DynamicDataDisplay, so I took the example DirectX&nbsp;library from the latest nightly build and improved upon it myself. Please keep in mind that I developed it for my project's needs, so you may\r\n have to modify some things to fit yours, but I will try to explain the things you an change to make it easier.</p>\r\n<p>First, I want to go over the changes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>I upgraded to the latest SlimDX library from June of this year, so you will need to download that SDK and/or binaries in order to build the project.\r\n</li><li>I scrapped the DirectXHost class after working on it quite a bit in favor of the example SlimDXControl included in the SlimDX SDK.\r\n</li><li>I moved the TransparencyEffect into its own effect library to make compiling easier to handle. It uses the ShaderBuildTask from the WPFToolkit. This may not be necessary, but I left it just in case.\r\n</li><li>I replicated the class hierarchy from the main D3 library in order to host a DirectXLineGraph just like you would a normal WPF LineGraph in the ChartPlotter class.\r\n</li><li>I implemented a timer to control the rendering loop instead of the CompositionTarget.Rendering event. It seemed net some more performance since you are not relying on the WPF rendering loop to trigger.\r\n</li><li>I created some extension methods that duplicate the AddLineGraph() methods ,which you can look at and duplicate if you need to.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>Now, to build it, you will need the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Download the source: DynamicDataDisplay.DirectX2D and TransparencyEffect. Those files are located here:&nbsp;<a title=\"Source\" href=\"http://cid-0cd3e1f8014fc24f.office.live.com/self.aspx/Source%20Code/D3.DirectX.zip\">http://cid-0cd3e1f8014fc24f.office.live.com/self.aspx/Source%20Code/D3.DirectX.zip</a>\r\n</li><li>Download and install the latest SlimDX SDK here:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://slimdx.org/download.php\">http://slimdx.org/download.php</a>. You will probably have to fix the reference to the SlimDX library installed on your machine.\r\n</li><li>You will need to install the ShaderBuildTask to build the TransparencyEffect library. You can download that here:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://wpf.codeplex.com/releases/view/14962#DownloadId=40167\">http://wpf.codeplex.com/releases/view/14962#DownloadId=40167</a>\r\n</li><li>In the main DynamicDataDisplay library, you will need to make one small change to the PlotterElement class. Change the accessor on the &quot;plotter&quot; member variable from &quot;private&quot; to &quot;protected&quot;.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>To use the new DirectXLineGraph, there has to be a SlimDXControl in the ChartPlotter.Children collection. You can add it in XAML or code. Then, you can add a new line graph. Here is an example in code:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>_chartPlotter.Children.Add(<span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> SlimDXControl());\r\n_chartPlotter.AddDXLineGraph(pointCollection, Colors.Green, <span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;description&quot;</span>);\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I have the line graph background color set to black, but you can change that in the SlimDXControl. Look for this line and change the color:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:blue\">private</span> Color4 _backBufferColor = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> Color4(1, 0, 0, 0);</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If I think of any more tips, I will edit this thread. Also, feel free to post any questions, comments or suggestions you have regarding my changes. I hope you guys can make use of it.</p>\r\n<p>Edit: I mistakenly put ViewportElement2D instead of PlotterElement in the last line of the build instructions.</p>\r\n",

So i added UpdateCore to DirectXLineGraph and a whole slew of things that it needs\r\n to support the method.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What is also important is a change in the&nbsp;AddDXLineGraph in the Plotter2DExtensions.cs You have to add the graph to the plotter before you set the datasource to the graph so the sequence of things is important so that the graph knows its plotter and\r\n the viewport and then knows how to deal with the data source when it is set. So this what I did&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:blue\">public</span> <span style=\"color:blue\">static</span> DirectXLineGraph AddDXLineGraph(<span style=\"color:blue\">this</span> <span style=\"color:#008080\">Plotter2D </span>plotter, <span style=\"color:#008080\">IPointDataSource </span>pointSource, <span style=\"color:#008080\">Pen </span>linePen, <span style=\"color:#008080\">Description </span>description)\r\n        {\r\n            <span style=\"color:blue\">if</span> (pointSource == <span style=\"color:blue\">null</span>)\r\n                <span style=\"color:blue\">throw</span> <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> ArgumentNullException(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;pointSource&quot;</span>);\r\n            <span style=\"color:blue\">if</span> (linePen == <span style=\"color:blue\">null</span>)\r\n                <span style=\"color:blue\">throw</span> <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> ArgumentNullException(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;linePen&quot;</span>);\r\n            \r\n            DirectXLineGraph graph = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> DirectXLineGraph();            \r\n            graph.LinePen = linePen;            \r\n            <span style=\"color:blue\">if</span> (description != <span style=\"color:blue\">null</span>)\r\n            {\r\n                NewLegend.SetDescription(graph, description.Brief);\r\n                graph.Description = description;\r\n            }\r\n            \r\n            graph.AddToPlotter(plotter);\r\n            graph.DataSource = pointSource;            \r\n            graph.Filters.Add(<span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> FrequencyFilter());\r\n            <span style=\"color:blue\">return</span> graph;\r\n        }\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>The DirectXChart inherits from ViewportElement2D which provides the Viewport and the Plotter2D properties. But we need to override these two properties in the DirectXChart so I have the two new properties in DirectXChart.cs file and these two functions are\r\n important for the filtering to work</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> <span style=\"color:blue\">protected</span> Plotter2D Plotter2D\r\n{\r\n    <span style=\"color:blue\">get</span> { <span style=\"color:blue\">return</span> (Plotter2D)<span style=\"color:blue\">this</span>.plotter; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n<span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> <span style=\"color:blue\">protected</span> Viewport2D Viewport\r\n{\r\n   <span style=\"color:blue\">get</span>\r\n   {\r\n      <span style=\"color:blue\">return</span> Plotter2D.Viewport;\r\n   }\r\n}</pre>\r\n<pre><br></pre>\r\n<pre>In your SlimDXControl.cs in the onRendering method you are setting the _needsRendering to always true and there by&nbsp;</pre>\r\n<pre>redrawing it several times and we dont want to do that.

However, I am working to contact somebody at Microsoft to change the license from Ms-RL to Ms-PL, so a lot of us&nbsp;would feel better about using\r\n it in our projects.</p>\r\n<p>Thank!</p>\r\n",

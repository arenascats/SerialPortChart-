I thought &quot;fit to view&quot; was doing that; I mean the axes were automatically scaled to fit the all shapes in plotter. We are using ZedGraph and there is an AxisChange method on GraphControl which does that. I searched the posted threads and seen that the this is done manually by setting the appropriate DataRect to the Plotter.Viewport.Visible.</p>\r\n<p>But we need this to be done automatically. Is this possible?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Hi Mikhail,</p>\r\n<p>The modification you did to the IntensityPlot example indeed gives better results. It seems this was the binding I needed. I also had some succes by modifying the viewport directly (by assigning a new DataRect to the View property).</p>\r\n<p>This actually brings me to a new question. By setting the binding to CentralGrid.ActualHeight somehow the viewport of the SectionGraph coinsides directly with the ends of the data (there is no &quot;gap&quot; beteween the graphed data and the border of the sectiongraph. In the prevous version the viewport was slightly bigger than the displayed data. Why is this? I have been looking a bit at the code but some subtle interactions between the different poperties are not always clear to me...</p>\r\n<p>To answer you last question: Before I found out about the IntensityPlot in the nightly I initially tried the IsoPlot to display my data by just changing the datasource for the supplied IsoPlot example by my data. This dataset was 400*400 points but for some reason it was really slow. I will have a look again to see if the DrawLabels have something to do with this.</p>\r\n<p>Your library is really an amazing set of controls. I will surely be looking at it more closely the coming days. Do you think it might be useful for your product if people would assist in documenting the functionality some more? (Things like the problem I had, etc...) Maybe writing a more detailed manual about the different features?</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>KrisJ</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

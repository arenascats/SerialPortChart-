The OnRender method in isolines example uses annotater and isolines text labels which are specific to isolines, how can i achieve the same with linegraphs? I don't want you to write the code (thought glad if you can write it) but any hints would be great assistance.</p>\r\n<p>I know one way to achieve this would be by attaching text label with the viewport2d, but then the labels would be attached to X and Y value and needs to be re-rendered and reposition again when the user zoom in/out.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Hi!</p>\r\n<p>If you do not need to update the number of labels being drawed while zoom, then <strong>ViewportHostPanel</strong>&nbsp;can be a good solution for you. It can host any UIElement, and by using its attached poperties like <strong>X</strong>, <strong>Y</strong>, <strong>ViewportWidth</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>ViewportHeight </strong>(or maybe <strong>ViewportBounds</strong>) you can archive behaviour of textlabels similar to isolines.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you need to change your labels while zooming, than I'm sorry and you'll have to do this part manually.</p>\r\n<p>Best regards,</p>\r\n<p>Mikhail.</p>",

Instead you can use ViewPortPolygon.\r<br />\n<br />\nYou might have used &quot;CompositeDataSource&quot; Or &quot;EnumerableDataSource&quot; to draw the line graph.\r<br />\nThis CompositeDataSource gives you the points collection CompositeDataSourceObject.GetPoints(), these points you can map to ViewPortPolygon Points.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards\r<br />\nRavi.<br />\n",

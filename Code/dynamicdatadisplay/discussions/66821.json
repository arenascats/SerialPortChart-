    "Html": "<p>Hi jane,</p>\r\n<p>Control that contains all descriptions is called Legend. Legend is placed on Canvas internally in Plotter.</p>\r\n<p>There are four properties of Legend - LegendLeft, LegendRight, LegendTop and LegendBottom that are simply wrappers of Canvas.Left etc attached properties.</p>\r\n<p>So you can place legend everywhere you want - just change those values. Do not forget that Canvas.Top and Canvas.Left have precedence over Canvas.Right and Canvas.Bottom, so you should clear ( == set to Double.NaN) Canvas.Left or Canvas.Top to make Canvas take Canvas.Bottom aтв Canvas.Right into respect.</p>\r\n<p>Tomorrow there will be a small sample about this.</p>\r\n<p>Also, one of our samples uses custom legend position - it is or CurrencyExchangeSample, or StockExchangeSample, I don't remember exactly without VisualStudio opened) Both these samples are in Samples directory.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Mikhail.</p>",

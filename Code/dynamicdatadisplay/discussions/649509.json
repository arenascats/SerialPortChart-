In other words, I need to show the chart pieces relative to a set of grid lines that reflect the size of the chart at all zoom levels (e.g. 10x10 units per box).<br />\n<br />\nUsing DrawHorizontalMinorTicks and DrawVerticalMinorTicks gets me something resembling what I want.  All I need now is to learn how to set the tick frequency to a specific, fixed value.  As-is, when I zoom my chart, I get more ticks, which I don't want.  I would think that if there's a way to set the tick frequency that will also solve my zoom problem.  I mention it here just in case it doesn't.<br />\n<br />\nI'm using the WPF library.<br />\n<br />\nAny input would be appreciated, thanks.<br />\n<br />\nHappy New Year.<br />\n<br />\np.s. &quot;Graphy&quot;... oops<br />\n",

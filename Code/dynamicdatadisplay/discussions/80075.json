Especially the graph zoom, multiple Y Axis, Axis Navigation, Horizontal Line and Horizontal Range. Everything is design excellent to the best of the Business model. Its show a Fantastic research work. Thanks team.</p>\r\n<p>I also have a query on a very basic feature of any graph. Which is about a Range functionality on&nbsp;a Axis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I would like to specify the graph with range value as</p>\r\n<p>Example:</p>\r\n<p>Xaxis: Min = 01-01-2010, Max: 06-01-2010,&nbsp; Step = 1 and Yaxis: Min =&nbsp;0, Max = 50, Step = 10</p>\r\n<p>Then data co-ordinates could be&nbsp; (01-01-2010, 15), (02-01-2010, 25) and so on....... but at moment if i am not wrong the range is set by the data co-ordinates received from&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size:x-small;color:#2b91af\"><span style=\"font-size:x-small;color:#2b91af\">EnumerableDataSource&lt;&gt; </span></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What i am missing is something like in static without the <span style=\"font-size:x-small;color:#2b91af\"><span style=\"font-size:x-small;color:#2b91af\">EnumerableDataSource </span></span>passed</p>\r\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\n<p>50</p>\r\n<p>40</p>\r\n<p>30</p>\r\n<p>20</p>\r\n<p>10</p>\r\n<p>0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01-01-2010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 02-01-2010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 03-01-2010&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 04-01-2010</p>\r\n<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\n<p>1. I have download the CHM documentation file and opened it, the links inside the chm are failing.</p>\r\n<p>2. I read various samples of AxisControl and discussions. ( i am missing something ?)</p>\r\n<p>3. I went thru the code, the 'Range' class is made get accessor and no set accessor is available. (Is it because of any design perspective reason ?)</p>\r\n<p>Could you please give me light on how to achieve this in D3 ? Any advise is much appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>Many Thanks in advance,</p>\r\n<p>Sathya</p>",

    "Html": "Hi Team,\r<br />\n<br />\nCurrently, I have developed a graph using ChartPlotter and Im trying to achieve a functionality where user can provide maximum and minimum values of Y-axis in a text box or slider, so that chart/graph should fit into user given MIN and MAX range of Y-Axis. I don't bother about X-axis range, best way could be change the X axis range in proportion to Y-axis range.\r<br />\n<br />\nI came across several posts on all types of <strong>&quot;Restrictions&quot;</strong> and tried accessing current range of X-axis and Y-axis values using <strong>plotter.ViewPort.Visible</strong>, but, failed to implement such functionality. There is a functionality called <strong>BringIntoView()</strong> on top of ViewPort of plotter object, but, not sure how to use this function. :(\r<br />\n<br />\nCould you, anyone, please suggest me on how to achieve this Fit To Y Axis Range functionality. Help to this question would be a lot to me and thanks in advance.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\nKumar<br />\n",

Luckily, I managed to get what I wanted and here is how.<br />\n<pre><code>           Rect rect = plotter.Viewport.Visible.ViewportToData(plotter.Viewport.Transform);\n            double factor = Convert.ToDouble(maxYvalue - minYvalue) / rect.Height;\n            Rect newRect = new Rect() { X = rect.X, Y =minYvalue, Height = rect.Height * factor, Width = rect.Width * factor };\n           if (!rect.IsEmpty)\n            {\n                Rect test = newRect.DataToViewport(plotter.Viewport.Transform);\n                plotter.Viewport.Visible = test;\n            }</code></pre>\n\nHope, this solution is helpful to others who are in need of it.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\nKumar<br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi Kumar,\r<br />\n<br />\nSaw your above post, similar to something which I am trying to do as well. I want to get the Min and Max values of the horizontal and vertical axes currently on display. i.e. once I zoom in/out the current linegraph on my chartplotter, I want to extract the current starting and ending values of both axes using a button click or something. Seeing your above solution, I think it is for setting those values. Any idea on how to extract those values? Your reply is much appreciated.\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you!<br />\n",

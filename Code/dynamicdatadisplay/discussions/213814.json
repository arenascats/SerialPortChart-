    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>It appears as though there is a memory leak in D3. I have an application that creates a few charts with very large data sets. It then drops all references to the charts and the data. Profiling the application shows that System.Windows.<strong>EffectiveValueEntry</strong>[] is still holding a reference to DynamicDataDisplay.DataSources.CompositeDataSource which holds a reference to the data. &nbsp;Thus the data cannot be GC'ed. Has anyone else noticed this behavior? Does anyone know what I can do to prevent it?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Kelly</p>",

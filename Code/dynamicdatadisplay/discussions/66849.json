Turns out my clients would like me to hide that yellow bar (they can see the date in the crosshairs). Is it possible to hide that part? I would like to keep the rest of the axis (the ticks and black labels) but hide the yellow bar.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for the help,</p>\r\n<p>Kelly Vanee</p>",

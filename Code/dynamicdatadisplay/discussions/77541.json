It would seem to say that any installation using this software has to include the full source of DynamicData, and if we modify any part then those modificaitons&nbsp;must be open as well. Would this include implementing some of your interfaces? eg. if we wrote a new plot type xyz, does that become open source?&nbsp; Am I reading it correctly?</p>\r\n<p>Any clarificaiton would be great.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Paul.</p>",

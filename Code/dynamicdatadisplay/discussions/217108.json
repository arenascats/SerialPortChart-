I am a student quite new to this community and currently working on a WPF/VB.NET  project which involves line and bar charts. I have successfully finished line chart implementation by looking at the samples provided, however could not find any working bar chart sample. I have very less time to complete bar chart. I would really appreciate if someone can help me out showing how to make a simple  bar chart using static data points. Would be great if someone has a sample working code and can post it or email me.\r\n\r\nThanks",

I had a look at the sample that is available for two lines with two scales, but it seems like they need to have the same xDatasource.</p>\r\n<p>Can you please give me some ideas how I can go about doing this with a dynamic Ydatasource?</p>\r\n<p>I would think that you will have to have 5 datasources, x, y1, y2, xy1 and xy2. You would then increment x, add the new values to y1 &amp; y2. However I have not been able to find a way to just add values to x, y1 &amp; y2. it seems like you have to re-create them.</p>\r\n<p>please let me know if their is an easier way to do this.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks &amp; Regards</p>\r\n<p>Cornelius Kruger<br>MediWatch</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Then wrap this collection by, for example, y-DataSource, and assign to LineChart.</p>\r\n<p>So you have to have 4 dataSources of double - x1, y1, y_for_x1 and y_for_x2.</p>\r\n<p>This should work.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Mikhail.</p>",

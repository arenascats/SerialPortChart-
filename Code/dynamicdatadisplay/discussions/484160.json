Zooming, Scrolling, Panning - everything works as it should.\r<br />\n<br />\nZooming in one step more somehow breaks the graph. When I pan on the x-axis, the graph suddenly disappears. Panning more on the x-axis, lets the graph flicker. \r<br />\nIn some situations, I use a vertical line cursor. When the graph is broken, I can use the LineCursor to &quot;erase&quot; the graph with the cursor.\r<br />\n<br />\nMinimizing and restoring or resizing the window, where the graph is displayed will redraw the graph so it is visible again, but the problem remains until I zoom out one step.\r<br />\n<br />\nThis only happens when the zoom level exceeds a specific level and it seems the graph is then not drawn anylonger. \r<br />\nIs there any fix or workaround for this?<br />\n",

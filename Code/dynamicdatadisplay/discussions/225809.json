When the plotter first draws, everything is OK, but when&nbsp;I&nbsp;maximize the window and the user control expands...the background grid in the ChartPlotter does not&nbsp;resizes&nbsp;properly, leaving a blank space on the right side of the plotter (the line graphs expand and so does the axis, but not the background).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>EDIT: Just in case I should say, I'm creating everything but the plotter and the axis labels dynamically.</p>\r\n<p>EDIT2: I have also just noticed that the background grid (which&nbsp;I&nbsp;believe is ChartPlotter.CentralGrid) is not resizing along with the rest of the plotter, so it doesn't keeps up with the change in the axis ticks.</p>",

I take the &quot;Value&quot; and the &quot;Number&quot; and add to my CompositeCollection. &nbsp;I've created rectangles on the plotter which are bound to the tolerance values.</p>\r\n<p>What I need help with is 1. Keeping the baseline in the center &nbsp;2. Automatically adjusting the Y to keep the rectangle visual appearance the same if the tolerance values change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Here is a picture that might help:</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"Example picture\" href=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/27471187/Graph.PNG\" target=\"_self\">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/27471187/Graph.PNG</a></p>\r\n",

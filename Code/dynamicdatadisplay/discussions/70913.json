You can try to use the newer version of markers, which is situated in DynamicDataDisplay.Markers.dll and has samples in NewMarkersSample project at DevSamples folder.</p>\r\n<p>You'll need to create a DevMarkerChart, set its MarkerBuilder property to an instance of MarkerBuilder (this is a thing that describes how markers are looking), for example, an EllipseMarker of CrossMarker or something custom build from WPF's template, and that assign your data (e.g., a collection of points - positions of each marker) to its ItemsSource property.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Do not hesitate to ask more questions.</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Mikhail.</p>",

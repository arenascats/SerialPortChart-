The only thing may be a FrequencyFilter (see Plotter2DExtensions file in D3's assembly - there are places where it is added to LineChart's Filters collection). The FrecuencyFilter is designed to work with horizontally aligned points.</p>\r\n<p>You can:</p>\r\n<p>not use AddLineChart extension methods and add LineChart with all necessary properties set manually. And here you can either don't use points filtering at all or create your filter that will filter vertical-aligned points.</p>\r\n<p>Best regards,</p>\r\n<p>Mikhail.</p>",

Unfortunately I was not able to get it running in the way I hoped it would be. Main problem for me was that documentation, especially for the silverlight version, is so poor that it is not possible to use D3\r\n in a practical application. Sample projects are also rare and WPF samples did not help very well because there obviously really major differences in both versions.</p>\r\n<p>Looks the way I am going for Visifire right now. As I have seen here many other people are frustated because of the lack of good documentation. Maybe you should consider this the main priority in your upcoming development. Nevertheless I hope you continue\r\n your overall good work.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Essentially I want it to work like the Simulation sample, just with the modification that after a certain number of data points (say 1000) has been added to the graph, the x-axis should automatically scroll to only show the last 1000 data points. Ideally it should be possible to scroll back in order to view older data points, and when a new data point is added the x-axis should again automatically scroll forward to show the 1000 most recently added data points (like a standard trading candlestick chart)</p>\r\n<p>The sample MultipleDataPoints is close to this behaviour and I could probably hack it to do approx. what I want, but I assume there is a better way to implement it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Regards and thanks in advance</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>First of all, some theory: DynamicDataDisplay's ChartPlotter (to be more precise, its Viewport) can be in two modes - 'FitToView' mode, when visible area is determined as a union of all charts' content bounds, and the second mode, when user (or programmer) have specified some value of plotter.Viewport.Visible and this value is a visible area, with no regard to charts' content bounds. Simulation sample works quite using this mechanism, so in the beginning chart is fitted to view and that's why its visible area is updated when content bounds of line chart changes.</p>\r\n<p>And now how can you solve your task:</p>\r\n<p>1) there is a special little system that can help you - it is called Viewport restrictions and it is a small bit of code that is called whenever viewport.Visible changes and allows you to change the way how the final value of visible is calculated. Also there are a little bit restrictions - those that are contained in FitToViewRestrictions collection of viewport - these are applied only when viewport is in fit-to-view mode. I have created a sample for you, it is available in the recent changeset (<a id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MasterContent_Content_ChangeSetList_ctl01_ChangeSetLink\" style=\"text-decoration:underline;color:#3e62a6;font-weight:bold\" title=\"Browse change set 29055\" href=\"http://dynamicdatadisplay.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/29055\">29055</a>), in DynamicDataDisplay.sln, and there in Samples/Simple solution folder. In this sample I'm adding to plotter.Viewport.FitToViewRestrictions a new instance of FixedWidthRestriction, which allows us to have visible only the latest <em>width </em>values of data.</p>\r\n<p>2) Also I have added a logic to the method that adds new point to data, that calls FitToView() method of Plotter - this is smth that you are describing like <em>when a new data point is added the x-axis should again automatically scroll forward to show the 1000 most recently added data points.</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Hope this sample will help you,</p>\r\n<p>Best regards,</p>\r\n<p>Mikhail.</p>",

When i add or remove entries in that collection, the axis and it's ticks change dynamicaly.</p>\r\n<p>When there are few entries in that collection, the ticklabelss in the graph are overriding each other. When there are a lot of entries in the collection, the resolution of the ticklabelss is quiet poor.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Is there a way to define the minimum- and maximum-count of ticklabels.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for your help.</p>\r\n<p>Regards</p>\r\n<p>Akki</p>\r\n",

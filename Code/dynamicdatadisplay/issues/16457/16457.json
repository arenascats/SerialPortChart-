    "Description": "I had a problem while changing ZIndex value in a MarkerElementPointGraph -> It changes, but the visual appearance is the same.\nÂ \nAfter some debugging, I found that the problem is that this Marker \"Element\" Point Graph is using a grid to create the items (elements), and adds this auxiliary grid to the main Plotter. Thus, their ZIndex value is not changed when the MarkerElementPointGraph is changed.",

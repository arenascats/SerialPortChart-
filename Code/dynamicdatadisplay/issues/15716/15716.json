    "Description": "Hi\n \nWhen applying a PointsFilter, the filter is called on every zoom change. This is done by setting the filteredPoints list to null in LineGraph.OnVisiblileChange and generating a new list in UpdateCore. \n \nThat is not done on panning, because in LineGraph.OnVisibleChange a if checks for Size of rect has changed. But size hasnt changed on pan. \n \nI found this bug when using a steplinefilter and setting the last point to screen width. That worked with zoomin but not when panning.\n \nA workaround for me was changing the size a little bit.",

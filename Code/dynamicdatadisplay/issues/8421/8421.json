    "Description": "When using multiple ChartPlotters in the same stackpanel,  the right click-> Copy picture will copy a black rectangle to the clipboard if used on the second or later ChartPlotters.\nÂ \nWorkaround:  Create a Border for each ChartPlotter and make the ChartPlotter the child of the border.  Add the borders to the StackPanel.  After doing this,  each ChartPlotter copies correctly to the clipboard.",

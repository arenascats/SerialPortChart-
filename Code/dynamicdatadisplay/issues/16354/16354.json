    "Description": "Hi there,\n \nDon't know if this project is still under active development, but since C#/VS has introduced new language Keywords (async/ await) it would be great if you would rename your variables in Methoddefinitions like\n \nPolylineEditor.cs\n   private void AddLineToPlotter(bool async){\n   \n   }\n \nOtherwise this Project can't compile when the Async CTP is installed.\nMore infos to the Async CTP: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/gg316360\n \nCheers",

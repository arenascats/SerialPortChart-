    "Description": "Hi,\n\nI am using D3 0.3.1 version.\n\nI have a line chart it works fine (y axis bottom to top) starts from 0,40 to 24,3000. -- Pic 1.png\n\nNow i am trying to invert the line (y axis top to bottom), this is achieved by using following link ( https://dynamicdatadisplay.codeplex.com/discussions/69390). But the issue i am facing is when it is displayed - y axis shows range from -40 to +40. it has to show only the visible graph area dynamically. -- Pic 2.png\n\ni.e, user has to scroll down the Y axis from -40 to +40 to view the line graph.\n\nExpected output - Pic 3.png\n\nThe same scenario is working fine in D3 0.3.0 version, issue occurs after migrating to latest D3 version.\nCan you please suggest a solution for it, how to display the graph in center and align the Y axis w.r.t it.\n\nPls find the attachment for pictures.\n\nThanks\nRaj",

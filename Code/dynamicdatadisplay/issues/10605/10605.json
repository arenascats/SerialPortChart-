    "Description": "Firstly, I would like to say thanks for a great product. I am just starting off with DDD and WPF, and the samples are a real help.\n \nAnyway, I am wondering what is the best way to display elliptical markers?\n \nI have a data set of (x,y) points. At each point I would like to add a marker (say a small cross), and surrounding each point I would also like to draw an ellipse. The ellipse for each point will have a different shape (height/width/rotation), which is a function of the (x,y) coordinates.\n \nI would also like to specify the ellipses in \"drawing units\" so that they rescale appropriately. So the question really is: Can I use an elliptical marker? If so how? Do I have to create an elliptical marker or ellipse shape sub class from an existing class.\n \nJust really looking for your thoughts / places to start. Any advice would be appreciated.\n \nI have attached a picture showing (sort of what I would like).\n \nKeep up the good work.\n \nCheers,\nBrian",

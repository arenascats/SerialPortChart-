    "Description": "Hi,\n\nI am using D3 0.3.1 version.\n\nI have a line chart it works fine (y axis bottom to top) starts from (0,40) to (24,3000).\n\nNow i am trying to invert the line (y axis top to bottom), this is achieved by using following link ( https://dynamicdatadisplay.codeplex.com/discussions/69390). But the issue i am facing is when it is displayed - y axis shows range from -40 to +40. it has to show only the visible graph area dynamically.\n\ni.e user has to scroll down the y axis from -40 to 40 to view the line graph.\n\nCan you please suggest me a solution for it.",
